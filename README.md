# Hello, I'm Emma 👋


## About Me ✨

Hello, digital world! I'm a developer, with focus on frontend who crafts engaging and user-friendly web experiences. My passion lies in building creative web applications that blend aesthetics with functionality.Add commentMore actions



When I'm not coding, you'll find me with knitting needles in hand, exploring color combinations and patterns. I have a soft spot for plants too - both my home and code benefit from thoughtful nurturing and growth!



I enjoy venturing into new technologies and occasionally crossing into fullstack territory with Node.js. I believe great interfaces should feel intuitive while still bringing joy to users.



🌱 Always growing, always learning, always creating something colorful...

## Current Focus

My current focus is to become better with writing efficent code, putting focus on writing DRY and secure code and learn more about tools and framework such as Zustand, Redux, Svelte. I also want to put more focus on making webb-applications that are fun, user-friendly and nice to look at.
